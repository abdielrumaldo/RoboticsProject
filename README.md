# Autonomous System: A Robotics Projects


This project was done under a time crunch while trying to create a functional robot with a handful of features. Most 
features were not succesfully included but it did leave us with a working barebones edition. Due to the time constratint
the project was not documented, optimized and very messy for the lack of a better word. 

Now that I have graduated I want to spend some freetime learning github, proper documentation and code optimization. This project is open to anyone who wants to learn or use. My goal is for this project to serve as a template for other students and hopefully provide ways solve the same problems we faced.

I only learned about the importance of documentation when I looked back on the code and had no idea what this project was about. I hope this project is able to help someone in the future, but for now it is just practice.
