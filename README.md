# RoboticsProject

# This project was originally created for the purpose of completing a project in order to graduate. 
# This put us in a time crunch while trying to create a functional robot with a handful of features. Most 
# features were not succesfully included and in the end we have a barebones project. Due to the time constratint
# the project was not documented, optimized and messy, for the lack of a better word. Now that I have graduated I
# want to spend time learning github, proper documentation and code optimization. This project is open to anyone
# who wants to use or copy the code. My goal is for this project to help other students go farther than I did as 
# we did not have a template or an example to help guide us. I only learned about the importance of documentation 
# when I looked back on the code and had no idea what it even was. I hope this project is able to help someone in 
# the future, but for now it is just practice.
